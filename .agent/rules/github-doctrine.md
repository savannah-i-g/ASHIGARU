## IMPORTANT
- GitHub commit & push actions must be taken, but only at the end of major updates & only after being asked.
- Versions should be bumped up in the package.json to reflect changes (2dp increase for small changes, large changes or more important changes can use the 1dp increase)
- Commits must not contain AI tags or AI-like language. Must be concise, professional & factual
