# Space Shooter Sound Effects

This game uses custom sound effects. Place the following MP3 files in this folder:

## Required Sounds

| Filename | Description | Suggested Duration |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `shoot.mp3` | Player firing a projectile | 0.1-0.2 seconds |
| `explosion.mp3` | Enemy destroyed | 0.3-0.5 seconds |
| `hit.mp3` | Player taking damage | 0.2-0.3 seconds |
| `powerup.mp3` | Collecting a power-up | 0.3-0.4 seconds |
| `gameover.mp3` | Game over sound | 1-2 seconds |

## Notes

- All files should be in MP3 format
- Keep file sizes small for quick loading
- Short, punchy sounds work best for gameplay
- If sounds are missing, the game will still work (just silently)

## Suggested Sources

- Free sound effect sites like freesound.org
- 8-bit/chiptune style sounds fit the ASCII aesthetic well
- Retro arcade game sound packs
